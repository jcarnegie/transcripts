Today marks another celestial cycle and my mood is somber on account of the tragic war in Ukraine, and all the people afflicted by this awful conflict. \\n\\nNone-the-less, I want to say a few things to myself, and aloud to you, my friends.  A stream of consciousness of what I wish for myself, and what I wish for you. \\n\\nHonor the impermanence of life; every day is precious, and we don‚Äôt know how much time we have here. \\n\\nLove. Live through love. And love yourself first. Be gentle with yourself, forgive yourself, give yourself permission to try, permission to fail, permission to love and permission to speak your truth. Love your family and close friends, accept them as they are, and don‚Äôt try to change anyone. And tell the people who matter why they matter to you. \\n\\nAttention. Attention is the greatest gift we can give one another. Our focus illuminates our reality. Stop yourself from focusing your consciousness on that which is wrong, and instead choose to focus on what is beautiful and right in your ¬´blessed¬ª life.\\n\\nGrow. Maintain empowering relationships with your mentors, teachers and coaches. If you find yourself overthinking, write. If you find yourself bored or uninspired, read. Read to know the world, especially the shades of humanity. Travel will wake you up and inspire you, and give you space to reevaluate. Do not settle in work, or in love. Ask for what you want directly. Exercise and eat healthy. Build the habit of actively clearing an overthinking mind, and returning to ¬´internal¬ª balance. \\n\\nJoy. Have goals, but don‚Äôt be hyper focused on what you want. Instead remember to enjoy what you have. Honor your path, it‚Äôs your journey and it‚Äôs all okay! Explore music and dance and art. Express yourself through all modalities. Take yourself lightly. Relax and slow down. \\n\\nBe kind to others. Use your power for good, to help your friends and teammates; don‚Äôt use your power to put people down. Set boundaries. Step through your ego. Be humble and generous.',\n",

Borka‚Äôs description as we stopped to take-in a vista overlooking the bay surrounding the port city of Puerto Montt still rings the truest.

I found it to be an exciting and highly effective way to explore. With whisking fresh air and swiftly unfolding landscapes, I appreciated the deeply rewarding physicality of it all. And there was a bona fide aspect of meditation ‚Äì a genuine mental repose, full of tranquility and contemplation. Robert Pirsig‚Äôs description of the satisfaction of motorcycling in ‚ÄúZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance‚Äù (I highly recommend the book if you have not yet read it) comes to mind;  ‚ÄúOn a cycle the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all. You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore, and the sense of presence is overwhelming.‚Äù  \\n \\n \\nPatagonia impresses with swift turquoise rivers, cutting through contrasts of vibrant emerald cultivation, juxtaposed with the bone-white, jagged towers of the Andes.
